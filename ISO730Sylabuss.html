          <h3>Catalog Description</h3>
          <p>This course is introductory to use Python for business analytics, intended for students with little or no programming experience. Students will learn how to program with Python and how to use it in conjunction with scientific computing modules and libraries to compute, analyze, and visualize data to make analytics-driven decisions in finance, operations, marketing, accounting, and management. By the end of this course, students will have confidence and understanding of how to program in Python, know how to create and manipulate arrays using NumPy library, know how to use Pandas library to create and analyze data sets, know how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create beautiful data visualizations, and have an understanding of Scikit-Learn for data analytics.</p>
          <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
          <p>None</p>
          <h3>Credit Hours:</h3>
          <p>3 credit hours</p>
          <p>A 14-week, 3 credit hour course is equivalent to 15-20 hours per week. Although the amount of time that you spend studying may depend upon the subject matter, a student should expect to spend an average of 18 hours each week participating in this class.</p>

                    Suffolk University has established processes to comply with the U.S. Department of Education’s credit hour definition, according to which a credit hour “reasonably approximates no less than (1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or
                    <br><br>
                    (2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.”
                    <br><br>

                <br><br>
                  A 14-week, 3 credit hour course is equivalent to 15-20 hours per week. Although the amount of time that you spend studying may depend upon the subject matter, a student should expect to spend an average of 18 hours each week participating in the regular class.

                    Suffolk University expects all students to be responsible individuals with high standards of conduct. Students are expected to practice ethical behavior in all learning environments and scenarios, including classrooms and laboratories, internships and practica, and study groups and academic teams. Cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration, use of unauthorized electronic devices, self-plagiarism, fabrication or falsification of data, and other types of academic misconduct are treated as serious offenses that initiate a formal process of inquiry, one that may lead to disciplinary sanctions.

                    Any time you see the word “research” or related concepts in your syllabus or on an assignment, there is a good chance that you will be required to locate, read, and incorporate information into your coursework from someplace other than Google. The University uses part of your tuition to pay for access to a wide variety of tools and resources located beyond firewalls on the web, undiscoverable or inaccessible to the casual searcher. Please visit the <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/academics/libraries/mildred-f-sawyer-library" target="_blank" aria-label="This link opens in a new tab.">Mildred F. Sawyer Library</a> in order to browse the many resources available to you.

                  <p>All assignments in this course will be evaluated based on the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>evidence of learning in accordance with the course objectives</li>
                    <li>depth of critical analysis</li>
                    <li>reference to relevant issues and materials</li>
                    <li>organization and thoroughness</li>
                    <li>effectiveness of argumentation/analysis</li>
                    <li>effectiveness of delivery</li>
                    <li>accurate and coherent use of language</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Assignments should demonstrate that you have analyzed and are thinking critically about the key issues in the course and relevant materials. Assignments should be logically presented, adequately supported and carefully reasoned.</p>
                  <p>All assignments should follow the APA (American Psychological Association) format guidelines. Visit <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html" target="_blank" aria-label="This link opens in a new tab.">Purdue OWL</a> if you need assistance using APA style guidelines.</p>
                  <h3>Guidelines for Written Assignments</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Use double-spaced, Times New Roman font size 12</li>
                    <li>Use one-inch margins all around and business-like fonts</li>
                    <li>Your name should appear only on the title page of your paper, not on any text pages</li>
                    <li>Use APA format (unless directed otherwise) for references and citations</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Guidelines for Presentations</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Preparation is key. See <a href="http://www.garrreynolds.com/preso-tips/prepare/" target="_blank" aria-label="This link opens in a new tab.">Garr Reynolds's Organization & Preparation Tips</a> for guidelines.</li>
                    <li>When creating slides, focus on simplicity and necessity. Slides should support you as a presenter; they should not take your place, nor should you ever read directly from them! See <a href="http://www.garrreynolds.com/preso-tips/design/" target="_blank" aria-label="This link opens in a new tab.">Garr Reynolds's Top Ten Slide Tips</a> for guidelines.</li>
                    <li>Always demonstrate professionalism. Whether you are presenting in person, in a synchronous live session, or in a video, you should dress in professional attire, ensure personal hygiene and grooming have been addressed, and that your presentation background is free of clutter, distraction, and noise.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Grammar and Punctuation</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Use complete sentences. Make sure each sentence has a subject and a verb to form an independent clause.</li>
                    <li>Avoid run-on sentences by separating the independent clauses in your writing with a coordinating conjunction.</li>
                    <li>Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction joining independent clauses and between all items in a series.</li>
                    <li>Be consistent in choosing the tense, mood, and voice of verbs.</li>
                    <li>Subject nouns and pronouns must agree with the verb form.</li>
                    <li>A common error is using a plural noun or pronoun with a singular subject because we are trying to avoid gender-specific pronouns. For example, we might say, "That employee enrolled in training to improve their likelihood of promotion." We could say instead, "That employee enrolled in training to improve the likelihood of promotion."</li>
                    <li>Do not use contractions.</li>
                    <li>Follow the rules for singular and plural possessives.</li>
                    <li>Learn to recognize and hyphenate compound modifiers and compound phrases.</li>
                    <li>Use spell-check and proofread. Review your writing out loud. Sometimes you will hear problems in the text that you do not identify by reading. Ask someone else to read your paper to identify those places where the text may be improved.</li>
                    <li>Read for clarity and simplicity. In many cases two sentences are more appropriate than one complex sentence with two concepts.</li>
                    <li>Review every sentence in your paper and ask yourself, "How can I write this to express my thought more clearly and with improved vocabulary?"</li>
                    <li>Write clearly and concisely</li>
                  </ul>
